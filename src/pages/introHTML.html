    <h2>Numerical Interpolation (interpolation polynomial)</h2>
        <p>Definition: The process of fitting a function through given data is called interpolation.<br>
        Usually when we have data, we don’t know the function f(x) that generated the data. So we fit a<br>
        certain class of functions.<br>
        The most usual class of functions fitted through data are polynomials. We will see why polynomials are fitted through data when we don’t know f(x).<br>

        <p>Definition: The process of fitting a polynomial through given data is called polynomial interpolation.<br>
    Polynomials are often used because they have the property of approximating any continuous function.<br>
    Given:<br>
            ◦ f(x) continuous on [a, b]<br>
            ◦ ε&gt;0 (called tolerance)</p>

        <p>Then, there is a polynomial P(x) of appropriate degree which approximates the function within the given<br>
    tolerance.</p>
        <p><br>Here we shall work with polynomials. These are functions with the following form:</p>

        \[ f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \ldots + a_nx^n \]

        <p>where n is any nonnegative integer,
        \[ a_0,a_1,\ \ldots.\ a_n \]
        are any fixed numbers, with 
        \[ a_n\neq0 \]</p>

        <p>Here are some terminology related to polynomials:</p>
        <table style="width:50%">
            <tr>
                <td style="text-align:center">
                \[ 1.\  n \ is \ called \ the \ degree,\]
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>\[ 2.\ \ a_0,a_1,\ \ldots.\ a_n\ are \ called \ the \ coefficients \] </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>\[ 3.\ \ a_0\ is \ called \ the \ constant \ terminology \]</td> 
            </tr>
        </table>
            
        
        <p>Polynomials have many uses in mathematics. Here we shall learn about polynomial interpolation. The following example introduces this.</p>
        <p>EXAMPLE:  Suppose that f(x) is a polynomial of degree 2 with \[ f(1)=2,\ f(2)=5,\ and\ f(4)=2. \]
        Find the formula of f(x).</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>SOLUTION: Since f(x) has degree 2, it must be of the form</p>
        <p>where the coefficient a,b,c are to be determined. Since f(1)=2,</p>
        \[ 2=a+b\times1+c\times1^2\]
        <p>Similarly, we get two other equations:</p>
        \[ 5=a+2b+4c\]
        \[ 2=a+4b+16c\]
        <p>Solving all the three equations together we get a = -4,b = 15/2,c = -3/2.</p>
        <p>In this example we say that f interpolates the three points (1,2), (2,5) and (4,2).</p>
        <p>We also call f an interpolating polynomial for this set of 3 points.</p>
        <p>Here we see that there is exactly one polynomial of degree 2 that interpolates these 3 points. A polynomial of degree 2 has 2+1=3 unknown coefficients, a,b and c.</p>
        <p> We solved for these from the 3 equations. This can be generalized to the following result.</p>
        <b>Theorem</b>
        <div style="padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid #333333; width:50%">
            <p>Suppose that we have n+1 points:
                \[ \left(x_0,\ y_0\right),\ \left(x_1,\ y_1\right),\ \ldots,\ \left(x_n,\ y_n\right),
                where x_0,\ \ldots,x_n\] 
                are distinct numbers (no such condition on the \[y_i\prime s).\] Then there is exactly one polynomial f of degree ≤ n that interpolates these n+1 points, i.e.,
                \[f\left(x_i\right)=y_i\ for\ 0\le i\le\ n\ \]
            </p>
        </div>
    <h2>Interpolation Using Equally Spaced Points</h2>
        <p>If the x-values are evenly spaced, getting an interpolating polynomial is considerably simplified. Instead of using divided
            differences, “ordinary differences” are used; the differences in f -values are not divided by the differences in x-values. A delta symbol is used to write them and, for a table of N + 1 (x, f (x)) pairs, differences up the Nth order can be computed.
        <br>
        We suppose that the table has entries indexed from 0 to N. First-order differences are then written as ∆fi and are computed as 
        \[∆f_i=f_{i+1}-f_i,\ i=0 \] 
        Second-order differences, ∆2fi, are the differences of the first-order differences: 
        \[∆^2f_i=∆(∆f_{i+1}-∆f_i)\]
        which is easily shown to be 
        \[∆f_i=f_{i+2}-2f_{i+1}+f_i, i = 0, \ · · · , \ (N − 2). \]
        Higher-order differences are again the differences of the next lower-order differences. They can be computed from the original f -values:

        \[∆^nf_{i}=f_{i+n}-nf_{i+n-1} \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}f_{i+n-2}-・・・\pm \ f_{p}, \ i=9, · · · , \ (N−n).\]
   




        An interpolating polynomial of degree n can be written in terms of these ordinary differences, with x evaluated at x:<br>
        </p>
        \[p_n\left(x\right)=f_o+
        \frac{x-x_0}{∆x}∆f_o+
        
        \frac{\frac{(x-x_0)}{∆x}(\frac{x-x_0}{∆x}-1)}{2!}∆^{2}fo+
        \frac{\frac{(x-x_0)}{∆x}(\frac{(x-x_0)}{∆x}-1)(\frac{(x-x_0)}{∆x}-2)}{3!}∆^{3}fo+・・・+
        \frac{\frac{(x-x_0)}{∆x}(\frac{(x-x_0)}{∆x}-1)・・・(\frac{(x-x_0)}{∆x}-n+1)}{n!}∆^{n}fo\]
        <p>This form of the interpolating polynomial is called the Newton-Gregory forward polynomial.</p>
    
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Given this table of x, f(x) values, and the columns of differences, find f(0.73) from a cubic interpolating polynomial.</p>
        <p>In order to center the x-values around x = 0.73, we must use the four entries beginning
            with x = 0.4. That makes xo = 0.4 and s = (0.73 - 0.4)/0.2 = 1.65. Inserting the proper
            values into the expression for the Newton-Gregory polynomial, we get </p>
